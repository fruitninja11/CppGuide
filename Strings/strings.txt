String is a class. And variables of string are objects of string class.

String vs Char arrays
Memory:
Strings: Run time memory allocation
Char arrays: we have to give a size of array, compile time memory allocation. 
char arrays have static memory allocation.

Implementation:
string are slower in access
char arrays are faster in access

Strings are 1d character arrays.
Strings end with a null character '\0'
While taking input using cin >> if input has space, tab (\t) or new line(\n) the input execution stops
